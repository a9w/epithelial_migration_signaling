    Use interface mask to refine a cell-cell junction.

    An "interface" is defined as bright blob that spans two neighboring cells.
    The portion of the interface that overlaps with each cell is called a

    an interface spanning the two cells, and then updates the two cell shapes so
    that the junction between then takes the shortest curvy path while remaining
    within the interface itself. This is based on the assumption that cell-cell
    interfaces tend to be mostly straight in epithelia.
